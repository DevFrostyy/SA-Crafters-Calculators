# SA-Crafters-Calculators
A calculator program I am developing for a Minecraft server containing useful tools like profit calculation and smelt time.

These are the files to all the versions of the calculator I am making. I first designed one in Lua for the CCEmuX Emulation software (Which emulates ComputerCraft) and now I am developing a version for Python.
Once I have the GUI set up I will start the actual development. For now I will release updates and revamps for the current one.

Enjoy :)
